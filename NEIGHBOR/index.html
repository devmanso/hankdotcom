ARTICLE 1 
<P>
I have had enthusiastic and gratifying reports from many of my clients,(Neighbornode users).  
As I expand the capabilities of my particular Neighbornode to include the adjacent streets; 
more members check in weekly.  
The current range of my particular Neighbornode is a little less than 3000 feet from my 
outside antenna and includes the high school 1 block away.  
Many of the students check in during lunch with their laptops from their cars in the parking lot.  
I am not interested in increasing the range much past the existing 3000 foot radius as 
I want to provide the best data rate possible to the existing clients.  
IN fact, in the future I may have to scale it back for that exact reason.  
It all depends on the number of clients that want to use my particular Neighbornode.  As more 
Neighbornodes come on line in my area, I will cut back accordingly.  Neighbornode works best if it covers 
your neighborhood well.  The range project here at the lab is an experiment, all be it, a long running one.  
Currently, My DSL connection is running at about 3 Megabits/second.  
Presently that is enough to provide all users adequate thru-put.  
In my opinion the EL-SPAZMO Friendly Service Neighbornode is a spectacular success in my neighborhood.  
If any of the other Neighbornode stations  wants to know how to expand the capabilities of their 
particular Neighbornode access point to get more than the 300 foot range, or just more reliable 
connections out to 1000 feet; have them drop me a line at my E-MAIL here. 
That E-MAIL address is libawitz@hotmail.com 
I'll be glad to tell them how I did it and how much it will cost.  
The really cool thing about it all is that it is perfectly legal and uses off the shelf, plug N play, hardware.  
Keep up the good work.  The Neighbornode software works perfectly.  It was well thought out.  
<P> 
Here is a range increasing hint.  
Mounting the WRT54G unit higher and free of blocking obstructions is the key to long range.  
The higher the better.  Avoid the proximity of green foliage between you and the receiving site.   Trees or other 
growing things act like a screen  to microwaves and will stop them cold.  
void locating the device or antenna close to metal objects.  
The 80 milliwatt power of a WRT54G with the addition of a 7.5 DB antenna 
pair also sold by Linksys is more than adequate to go well over 2000 feet (if the unit were placed 
on top of a tall building on the roof, outside, under a plastic bucket and no obstructions in the way), 
between the unit and your laptop computer.  The range would be astounding.  Most people can't do that however.  
That is why ancillary equipment must be added to boost the performance to acceptable range and thruput.  
This requires a power booster for the base station and the incorporation of a high gain 
antenna mounted in the clear remotely.

I have experimented with both types of systems depicted here at my lab.  
These are some of the results of my investigations.
Inquiries may be directed to libawitz@hotmail.com or now on my 
Neighbornode's bulletin board:  ELSPAZMO's FRIENDLY SERVICE NEIGHBORNODE
 
This shouldn't take too long.  It's really quite simple, really.
We begin with the WRT54G which is set up in Neighbornode mode.  
I immediately replaced the small 3-DBI antennas that came with the WRT54G with a Linksys 7.5 DBI 
gain antenna pair and set the output of the WRT54G to 50 miliwatts, not the maximum power, (80 milliwatts). 
A word of caution about setting the unit to full power, (80 milliwatts).  Even though the unit is designed to 
provide reliable operation at the maximum, (80 milliwatt) power; 
At full transmit power the WRT54G will tend to overheat.  Heat is the long term enemy of electronic equipment.  
As a general rule of thumb, it is best to place the unit in as cool a location as possible.  
Keep it out of the sun.  Allow air to freely circulate around the unit.  Use a small fan if necessary.  
A small muffin fan is obtainable at Radio Shack.  They sell a small 3" fan that can be placed off to one side of the 
WRT54G.  Let it blow across the unit.  The air will go across the top and bottom, keeping the unit at ambient temperature.   
To preclude possible crashes and damage to the WRT54G keep the power to 50 milliwatts if you don't use a cooling fan.   
That accomplished, we continue:   The 4 hardwired ports on that unit are 
subject to the same login requirements the wireless clients are, as directed by the timer value which is defaulted to 
24 hours on the WRT54G Neighbornode software.  That means every computer 
connected to the unit's hardwired port must login at least once every 24 hours 
just like the wireless computer systems.  This comes in very handy when a REPEATER 
or WIRELESS ACCESS PORT is used in conjunction with the WRT54G; as I will explain shortly.  
The timer function may be changed to once every 4 hours if desired and I recommend it.  
This keeps malingers from hanging on for ever, (if you know what I mean).  
Any way, there are two ways to increase the wireless range.  
Assuming first you did the absolutely cheapest way to increase your range;  
which means you having the WRT54G mounted in as high and clear as location 
as possible in your home.  That may mean putting the unit on the upper floor next to a 
window or mounted on the roof in a rain proof plastic bucket or other water proof 
plastic enclosure. Do what you need to locate the WRT54G as high and in the clear 
as possible.  That is the main thing to do. It's free, and you may not have to add  
the high gain LINKSYS antennas mounted on the back of your unit.  If you can't do 
that then consider one of the two following methods to greatly increase the range 
of your Neighbornode.   The method you use will determine the overall cost.  
I may as tell you now I opted for Method Two below but your situation may be different.
<P>
<H1> 
<CENTER>METHOD ONE<CENTER>
<H4>
<P> 
The easiest, is to set up is a repeater.  
I use a HAWKING HWUR54G, (available at: http://www.compusa.com ). 
In repeater mode, the SSID of the WRT54G must be entered as the main ID.  
In that case is 'Neighbornode' as per the set up instructions 
provided with your setup software from Neighbornode.  The repeater's output SSID must be something different.  
I use: 'Neighbornode - REPEATER' as the Repeater's SSID.  When you do a search of 
available networks on your portable computer in my neighborhood you would see both SSID's: Neighbornode & 
Neighbornode - REPEATER; unless you're out of range of the original WRT54G.  
Then you will only see the REPEATER.  Mounting the repeater up high as possible 
is most important.  It must be in range of the main unit, (WRT54G) and yet far 
away enough to effectively increase the range in the direction you want to extend 
the coverage.  A single Linksys 7 DBI gain antenna may be added to the repeater for 
more gain.  It is very easy to set up and only requires the repeater to be set to the 
same channel as the Linksys WRT54G.  I set both units to channel 2.  
Linksys sets their channel to 6 as the default.  
There are so many units on that channel they cause interference and 
packet collisions with each other. That will diminish the range and performance 
of your system.  That why I choose channel 2 in my neighborhood.  Your's may be different.
The one down side is that repeater is transmitting all 
the time,( the WAN lamp is winking continuously on the repeater).  All that means is 
that the repeater itself causes a little interference and really uses 
the channel.  That is the reason why you should find an channel that 
is relatively unused in your area.  If an additional repeater is desired to further 
increase the range of your system then that repeater must be placed in the 
opposite direction that the first repeater is located and out of range of 
the first repeater UNLESS on the second repeater the SSID of the first 
repeater is used as the original SSID number, (in this case the original 
SSID of the first repeater is: Neighbornode - REPEATER and the second 
repeater's SSID must be something like: Neighbornode - REPEATER - MODE B and so on. 
Why do that?  Your house may be situated next to a hill or a tall building, 
(with no potential clients),and you want to greatly
extend the range of your Neighbornode in one direction but not the other.  A string of 
repeaters may be used in one direction to increase effectivity while ignoring the empty 
side of the hill or building behind you.  Additionally, high gain directional antennas with a cardioid pattern
may be aimed in the direction desired as well.  There are a lot of choices and configurations possible.
If multiple stringed repeaters are used,
you are then repeating the repeater, so to speak.  
All repeaters must be on the same channel as the WRT54G.  One further thing; 
after programming, none of them have to be connected via hard wire to the WRT54G.  
All they need is power and that is what makes it easy to deploy.  
The REPEATER could be placed on the roof of your home or apartment 
building in a plastic bucket and run off a battery that is solar charged 
for completely wireless and autonomous operation.  The small solar panel 
can be attached to the top of the bucket and the unit placed at any convent 
location within range of your WRT54G and yet high enough to provide long 
range connection.  Hawking also makes a 500 milliwatt power amplifier to 
daisy chain in the antenna circuit to increase your transmitter power and 
receive sensitivity considerably.  The part number for the power gain unit 
is the HSB1.  Yes, you can use a mast mounted hi-gain (9-DBI omni-directional), 
together with the power amp to make a powerful repeater. A 15 dbi antenna
may be used to increase the coverage even further.  More about that later. 
Be aware of the possible channel congestion problems requiring relocation 
of the repeater further away from the WRT54G main unit.  With the repeater 
so close by, sometimes getting into your main Neighbornode unit may be 
difficult.  Getting into the main Neighbornode base unit,(WRT54G) may actually be blocked by the 
REPEATER, especially if the 1/2 watt amplifier is used. 
So, The use of the REPEATER mode is sometimes problematic. It is best to 
mount the repeater as far away from your Neighbornode main unit as possible 
and yet still be in range to communicate.  When I used the high power 
additional equipment with my repeater IE power amp and pole mounted hi-gain antenna; 
I had to mount the WRT54G in the far corner of the lab and separate 
the repeater some 500 feet from the WRT54G to prevent difficulties in 
logging into the WRT54G directly rather than through the repeater.  
It will not make any difference to you which unit you connect with as 
the end results will be the same.  When using a pole mounted gain antenna 
that is free and clear, both the repeater and access point ranges will 
be about 3000-7000 feet.  This implies you are using a conventional 
Linksys wireless card plugged into the side of your computer and you are 
line of sight to the base station antenna.  If a 14 DBI corner reflector 
antenna is connected to  a PCI card in your laptop, you could be 3+ miles 
away from the access point antenna and still connect, that is, if you can 
see the base antenna and aim your corner reflected antenna carefully.  
Trying to push a microwave signal through walls greatly limits the effective 
range of everything.  Keep that in mind always.  Put as few obstacles between 
you, your clients and your Neighbornode main unit, repeater, or access point 
as possible.  In this case, less is more. One more thing:  
If you decide to use a pole mounted antenna on the roof it will be advisable to 
mount the repeater or access point and amplifier in a waterproof box (NEMA 400 type)
and connect to the high antenna with a very short,(less than 3 feet) pigtail or LMR400
cable to minimize cable loss.  Using a long cable can be quite lossy at 2.4 GHZ.  
Put the whole she-bang in the waterproof box and mount it just below the high gain antenna.
All that is required is to run power and the category 5 cable,
(In the case you decide to make it an access point you need the addition of a cat5 cable that 
is connected to one of the available 4 ports of the WRT54G, but not when used as a repeater.  
Yeah, I'll explain the use of the cat5 cable later too.) 
Using the access point method depicted next in 
Method Two will provide better service.
<P>
<H1> 
<CENTER>METHOD TWO<CENTER>
<H4>
<P>  
Uses an access point connected to port one of the WRT54G.  
I have set the SSID of the access point to be: Neighbornode - MODE B.  
You can use anything you want but include the word: 
Neighbornode as part of your SSID.  I use the HAWKING HWBA54G wireless 
access point and bridge I also use the HSB1 power amplifier. Also in that 
configuration is the use of a high gain 9 DBI gain roof mounted omni-directional 
antenna fed with LMR-400 cable that is 15 feet long.   I use  
the HWBA54G it in access point mode.  The access point needs to be 
connected to the WRT54G' port connection via a cat5 LAN cable.  I 
connect it to port 1 but you can connect it to any one of the 4 ports you like.
So, I mount the high gain antenna on the roof on top of a pole, 
mounted to the outside of the house just outside the side entrance to my LAB.  
I run the cable down the pole and into an access port just above the door.  
It is a very short cable. The shorter the better.  
Just inside the door I connect the other end of the cable to the 
output of the HSB1, which is connected via a pigtail to the HWBA54G.  
Both units are powered by a wall wart transformer.  
A 75' cat 5 cable runs from the access point to the port 1 of the WRT54G 
located else where in the lab.  
With a category 5 cable, you can separate the access point almost 300 
feet away from the WRT54G.  Actually, that is true no matter what device you use.  
Once set up, the access point reliably 
allows wireless connections from computers very far away, 
(several thousand feet), without the use of repeaters.  I also put the 
access point on a different channel than my WRT54G to further minimize 
interference.  You can't do that with a REPEATER if you recall.
So, Lets review:  A repeater is simple to implement.  No hardwire 
connection is required between the repeater and WRT54G.  
It's downside is greater channel congestion with sometimes packet 
collisions requiring the re-sending of data.  That slows things down a bit.  
Limited connectivity.  Only a handful of stations can connect 
simultaneously on a repeater.
An access point however, provides greater thru-put, further range,  
less channel congestion, more reliable connections with more power 
& sensitivity.  A category 5 cable is required for constant connection 
with the WRT54G; and the overall expense is greater but the system 
performance is much better.  I Use this method because I wish to further 
experiment with range increasing techniques & because I had one 
laying around in the LAB..
<P>
As I said, using HAWKING access points in repeater mode is the easiest 
way to greatly extend your Neighbornode�s coverage area.  
I also indicated that method was sometimes problematic.  
Still another solution to the range question is to use two 
access points back to back in BRIDGE mode.  
In this case the WAN ports of each access point are connected 
together with a short Category 5 cable.  Different antennas may be connected 
to each of the access points, depending on your situation.  The coverage area will begin 
anew from that point.  The Neighbornode SSID may be used with 
all units and they will reliably relay connections from the 
local computer to your master Neighbornode WRT54G box.  
This is especially useful in very long extensions.  
Corner reflector antennas or Yagis may be used to �beam� 
your signal to remote regions or to another bridge system.  
A couple Ham friend of mine used that method, along with � watt 
amplifiers from Hawking and 4 foot dish antennas to relay their 
signal 350 miles up the SanJauquin Valley out here in California. 
It took two bridge systems in between base stations to complete the hookup.  
They also had to adjust the software so the timeout function was increased so the 
units would not start to resend the data because they did not get a timely response 
from the remote unit.  Even traveling at the speed of light, distances over 18 miles have to 
be adjusted to compensate for the propagation delays.  
It can really get wild!  
<P> 
I have the other three ports on my WRT54G to play with.  
I may add another access point to port Two and connect it to 
a dish antenna (42 inches) and aim it at my ranch in the mountains 
18 miles away, as the crow flies.  I will be able to connect using 
the camera tripod mounted 14 DBI corner reflector aimed back at the 
dish.  Neet huh?.  Yeah, I have a Sprint wireless card for my computer 
but who wants to pay for all that when I can connect to my own network 
& the internet, for free, at home, from my ranch home?  It will require 
the use of the 500 milliwatt amplifiers on each end however.  
Using that setup, the possible range is over 80 miles.  
I  would have to do some adjustment delays to the timeout before 
repeating of packets to prevent repeats and collisions.   
If you are into experimentation clearly the access point route is 
the way to go.
<P> 
There you have it except for the omni directional antennas I used.  
There are several vendors who supply antennas.  
I like using the HAWKING equipment because they sell everything, 
including the cable, that is needed for your installation; all of it 
available at the CompUSA web site.  There are other vendors who offer 
a 16 DBI antenna that is omni-directional but cost much more than the 
9-DBI omnidirectional antenna provided by HAWKING.  Be advised,  
HAWKING predicates their performance with the use of their 10 foot 
cable and some of the other suppliers don't.  That really means the gain of 
the HAWKING antenna is better than some of the other published antennas who 
don't take into consideration feed line length in their gain 
calculations and subsequent gain publication.  Their gain figures may 
indicate higher antenna gain but their performance may be considerably 
less.  Use HAWKING equipment for the best results. There are notable exceptions
however.  WIFI-Link is one of those 'good' guys that publish honest specs.  
If you are interested go here:
http://www.wifi-link.com/product.php?action=product&class1_id=1&class2_id=50&class3_id=164&product_id=19
It probably best to copy and paste the url into your browser's URL line,  heh heh.  
No, I do not own stock in HAWKING or WIFI-LINK.  All of the hardware mentioned here 
is perfectly legal to use and is available off the shelf at your local 
computer supply store or via the network at one of the online computer 
equipment supply houses.  I use COMPUSA because their prices are reasonable, 
they are pleasant to do business with and they ship overnight.  Have fun.

Oh yeah, before I forget.  If you really want to vastly increase your range far past
what we have discussed here; then get yourself an amateur radio license.  
Under FCC part 97, vastly increased power levels are allowed.  
Very high gain antennas are also allowed under Part 97.  
This increased power level with the resulting increased
energy density will provide greater signal to noise ratios allowing greater transmission
speeds over longer distances.  Several manufacturers will provide higher power amplifiers to 
any amateur radio operator who provides a copy of their license.  
Now we are talking power levels of 10, 20 watts, or more!.  Really cool!  Think about it.

FAQ
<P>
Question:
<p>
HOW CAN I PROVIDE A NEIGHBORNODE SERVICE WITHOUT JEOPARDIZING THE SECURITY OF MY HOME OR OFFICE SYSTEM?
<P>
Answer:
I am going to assume you already have an existing home network or one that needs to be protected.  
I also am going to assume the home network is made by Linksys, but it doesn�t have to be.  
Most are but this technique will work with any system.  As you know the default IP of the 
Linksys router & switch is 192.168.1.1.  This is the same no matter how many ports 
your router/switch has.
Hook your WRT54G to an available port on the main switch.  
Change the IP of the WRT54G from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.2.1.  
When you do that the systems will be totally separate from each other.  
People connected to the WRT54G will not be able to see the computers connected 
to the main router and visa versa.  This is a technique used by technicians to 
separate sales, lab, etc from payroll for instance. Yet they all will have access 
to the INTERNET.  Now, the main point to remember is if you are using like equipment 
like Linksys, the IP�s of the routers have to be different if you want to keep them separate.  
If you want to share the whole home network with the world then the IP of the second 
router (WRT54G) would be set to 192.168.1.2.    That is why it is good to change the WRT54G�s IP.   
There is one more thing to remember.  Computers connected to other available 4 ports of the WRT54G 
can talk to each other and can see each other�s files if file sharing is enabled on those 
computers.  It is best to hook only access points to the available ports of the WRT54G; 
and that only if you want to expand the capability of your Neighbornode system. 
<P>
Question:
<p>
WILL USERS ON THE NEIGHBORNODE SLOW DOWN MY INTERNET BROWSING?
<P>
Answer: 
Yes, a little but it is barely noticeable.  Really!  
If you are concerned you can slow down the data thruput of the 
WRT54G by setting the connect speed to 1  or 2  instead of 56 KB 
or somewhere in between.  
Your Linksys will automatically slow down the thruput in marginal 
conditions.  You can permanently slow down the �public� connection 
leaving more for you.  The impact of an occasional user or several 
simultaneous users is minor.  
Anyway, providing a little internet access & bulletin board to your 
friends is why you are doing this in the first place. Isn�t it?  
Don�t worry about it.  Life is good.  Spread the joy.

<CENTER>  THE NEXT PHOTO IS OF THE WI-FI ANTENNA USED FOR THE NEIGHBORNODE SYSTEM HERE.  
IT IS ON A 15 FOOT MAST AND IS FED WITH LMR-600 TO REDUCE TRANSMISSION LINE LOSS.<CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="antenna.jpg"><CENTER></A>

<P>
The first picture shows how I installed the Neighbornode - MODE B access point
in my garage at the base of the 15 foot mast.  You can blow it up to see the connections better.  
As you can see, the black pigtail
leaves the access point on the upper left of the access point and routes to the input of the power amplifier
on the left side.  The output of the power amplifier, (right side), uses a white pigtale that routes
to the fat LMR400 cable via a static discharge device in the left side.  
You can also see the white wire that is affixed to the bottom of the static discharge 
device which routes off to the left.  Unseen in that view, is where the wire connects to a cold water pipe; but it does.
Both the pigtails, (black & white) and the static discharge device are supplied 
with the HAWKING equipment. Everything is complete. The LAN cable routes to port 1 
of the WRT54G at the other end of the lab, aproximately 75 feet.  
A 100 foot Category 5 cable from Radio Shack worked perfectly.
The access point is installed just inside the garage wall to protect it from the weather.
I could have obeyed my own advice and place the access point in a waterproof box and mount it
just below the pole mounted antenna, feeding the antenna with a short pigtail), 
thus avoiding the loss of 15 feet of cable. I didn't. 
OK  I confess.  Do what I say, not what I do.  It will work the best.  
But not that much better, however.  15 feet of LMR600 cable will reduce 
your output power by approximately 1/6.  Your Receive sensitivity is marginally affected by the same.  
Only those stations far, in the distance, at the edge of your coverage area 
will notice any reduction in thruput.  
Do not buy the 30 foot cable supplied by HAWKING or anyone.  The loss will be too great.  
If you must use a longer antenna feed cable other than a 19 inch pigtail, 
use the 15 foot cable offered by HAWKING, no longer.
Notice the IP stickers I placed on the outside of the access point by using my handy label maker.  
I don't know what I would do without that wonderful machine.  It has saved my neck by jogging
my memory far too often to mention, without great embarrassment.  
The sticker on the left, (192.168.1.240) is the default IP of the access point 
which is used to program the operating parameters via the web access to the access point.
The sticker on the right, (192.168.2.101) is the IP provided automatically by the WRT54G to the 
access point and is the IP I use to connect to the access point 
should I want to adjust any of it's operating parameters.  
If you try to use the default IP, you will never connect.  That is why I put the blue arrow pointing to
the IP I am supposed to use while that device is connected to the Neighbornode WRT54G.  
This helps to keep me on track and reduce the confusion.
Should you later decide to use the access point as part of your house or office network; you would have
to use the original IP, (192.168.1.240). WHEW!  Did I really say all that?  How about misspelled words?
How many?  
I hope I did not put you to sleep.
You still awake?  OH well, the Third picture shows how I have configured the NEIGHBORNODE base station.  
If you look carefully, you will notice the port 8 lamp on the switch is illuminated.  That port
that is connected to the WRT54G' WAN port.  Ports 1 of the WRT54G is connected to the NEIGHBORNODE MODE-B 
long range access point which is shown in the above pictures.  Port #2 of the switch goes to an old laptop computer I use 
to chat with my MIRC buddies etc.  IT also used for ocassional adjustments of the WRT54G.  For instance 
this morning I realised that no one was connecting to my NEIGHBORNODE through the main unit so, 
I have lowered the output power of the WRT54G to below factory defaults.  
I only use it in the lab here and it is located less than 10 feet from the computer used.  All the other
communication through my NEIGORNODE, (by my neighbors) is done through the high power 
NEIGHBORNODE MODE-B access point.  I have replaced the stock antennas with 7 dbi gain antennas from Linksys.
That one addition did a lot to increase my range from the base unit.  
At the reduced power settings now used, the higher gain antennas fill out my lab just about right. 
Let me make myself clear.  I have reduced the power level of my main unit only because I have
a high power access point mounted on my roof connected to port 1 of the main unit to handle all of 
the Neighbors connection requirments.  If I did not have the access point,(NEIGHBORNODE MODE - B), 
I would be obliged to increase the power of my main unit and position it for optimum coverage.  As it is now 
it works just fine in the lab in the corner, on top of the speakers of my stereo unit.:)
<P>
QUESTION:	
<P>
How do you solar power the repeater?
<P>
ANSWER:	
<P>
Gather the equipment listed and connect them together as discussed here.  
<P>
Connect the batteries in series using the blade fuse holder between the batteries.
You will notice the batteries have their terminals towards one side of the top of the battery.
I positioned the batteries so their terminals are as close to each other as possible.  Even then,
They will still be about 1 inch apart.  Tape the batteries together using 2" wide Mylar tape. 
Use a lot of it. I tape it horizontally as around the center top to bottom.  The batteries should
have their plus and minus poles close together on each end.  On one of the ends of the two batteries,
solder the fuse holder, one to a Plus terminal the other end of the fuse holder to the 
minus terminal adjacent to it.  When you put a fuse into the holder you 
will then have a 12 volt battery rather than two 6 volt bateries.  
The battery will self disconnect if the current exceeds 3 amps.  The total
current  should never exceed 2 amps even under full solar charge.  
The extra 2 amps is a fudge factor.  Should anything go wrong, the 
fuse will blow immediately.  Do not use a higher value fuse!
Connect output of the solar panel charge controller to the other unused 
contacts at the other end of the battery. Next connect the solar panel 
to the charge controller.

NOTE:  The IPC Charge controller has the word BATTERY on top of the controller next to 
a RED & Black wire pair.  Those wires go to the battery.  
The other end of the controller does not have a label.  
It is those wires you connect the solar panel to. 
The red wire of the solar panel goes to the RED + or POSITIVE input  
wire of the IPC charge Controller.  The black wire of the solar panel 
connects to the BLACK � or NEGATIVE wire of the controller.  
older and tape the connection well.  
The RED wire of the IPC controller (LABELED BATTERY), goes to the + or POSITIVE terminal 
of the battery.  The Black wire of the IPC controller connects to 
the � NEGATIVE terminal of the battery. Before you solder the connections;    
Connect the wire with the white stripe of the Radio Shack power 
cord to the + POSITIVE battery terminal where the RED wire of the 
Charge controller was connected.  Connect the plain black wire of 
the power cord to the � NEGATIVE battery terminal where the Black 
wire of the IPC charge controller was connected.  Verify both wires 
are securely soldered to each terminal of the battery.  RED wire & BLACK wire with 
white stripe to battery + POSITIVE and Black wire from IPC controller & 
plain black wire from power cord to the � NEGATIVE terminal of battery.  
Solder carefully.  Put tape over the soldered connections.  All is ready.  
Plug in the 5 amp blade fuse into the fuse holder and 
place the solar panel in the sun.  As the battery is charging the yellow 
LED will glow.  Good Lord!  Is he going to talk all day? 
The Yellow and green LED�s will cycle on and off frequently 
as the charge controller is working normally.   When the battery is 
charging the yellow LED will stay illuminated.  When the battery is fully 
charged the LED�s will cycle.  Once the LED�s on the IPC Charge Controller 
start to cycle the battery set is ready to connect to the HAWKING repeater.
I use a HAWKING repeater because it runs on a 12 volt DC wall wart so it 
will work perfectly with this 12 volt solar system.  See the drawing next.
Plug in the power plug into the power jack on the HAWKING.  
Verify the blinking WAN lamp after a few moments.  It's working!

<CENTER>This is the battery I use for the solar power repeater system.  Notice the placement
of the fuse holder on the right.  For this configuration I use 2 X 12 amp, 
6 volt, gel cell storage batteries, taped together to make one large storage battery. 
I also use a cigar plug recepticle on the battery for easy connection
to a "Y" connector that I can use to connect the output of the charge controller, 
(from the solar generation system) & the power plug to the HAWKING repeater.  Every thing 
plugs together quickly.<CENTER>

Place the batteries in the bottom of the bucket with the charge controller 
next to them.  Cut out a piece of box cardboard in a circle which will 
just fit just inside of the bucket on top of the batteries and lay it 
on top of the batteries.  You can place the HAWKING repeater on top of 
the cardboard with the antenna connected to it, inside the bucket. 
Run the wires from the solar panel out and over the edge of the lip of 
the bucket to the solar panel.  Put the whole thing on your roof. 
(I put mine on top of my swamp cooler). Lay the solar panel next to 
the bucket and orient it so it faces a southerly direction.  
Verify the WAN light on the repeater is flashing indicating all is 
working properly.  Fit the lid on top of the bucket tightly. 
Put a plastic bag over the bucket and another bag over the first bag.  
Fold the opening of the bags under the bucket so the bucket sits on 
them and holds the bag closed.    GEE WHIZ; He is going to talk forever!  
I put a brick on top of my repeater�s 
lid to keep the whole thing in place if the wind should blow too hard.  
Give your repeater a couple pats on the lid and go down stairs.  
You�re done except to occasionally verify the LED�s are cycling by 2PM.  
On new batteries, the LED�s will cycle slowly.  
On older batteries the LED�s will cycle more frequently.  
The Batteries will keep the repeater alive for 5 days if it gets cloudy.  
If it stays cloudy for 4 days it may take two days of full sun for the 
batteries to fully recover.  When the LED�s cycle you�re ok.  
If not, you may have to add another solar panel to get more charging 
current so the LED�s do cycle.  In Southern California, one panel 
is all that is required.  Northern climates may require two.  That�s 
why we use the 10 amp hour batteries; to keep the repeater alive and 
functioning during cloudy days.  The charge controller is used to keep 
the battery from overcharging and shorting its life.  
The charge controller is a must so don�t scrimp.  Also, do not use 
lead acid storage batteries like those used in automobiles or motorcycles.  
The acid fumes will destroy the electronics & deep discharge cycles will 
destroy the lead-acid battery.  Always use a Gel-cell or Nickel Metal Hydride battery.

QUESTON:  
<P>
What if I want to SOLAR POWER two ACCESS POINTS used in BRIDGE mode as suggested earlier?
<P>
ANSWER:
<P>
You will have to triple up on the solar panels and make two 12 volt Gel-cell wired up
in parallel to provide a larger storage battery.  Remember, you are powering two ACCESS POINTS 
and two HSB1 power amps, one for each bridge.  The cost triples.
