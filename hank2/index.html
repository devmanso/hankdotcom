HAVING PROBLEMS CONNECTING?  Here is some help.
FIRST: Make sure your FTP client is in the PASIVE MODE.  I know it shouldn't matter but for some it seems to.
EXAMPLE:
Using the free WS_FTP.exe program; select connect.  In the SESSION PROFILE window, select ADVANCED.  
Verify PASSIVE TRANSFERS has a check by it.  If it doesn't, put one there. 
Click OK then click SAVE before you click on OK to connect with me.  Other than that;
most connect failures were caused by one or more of the following reasons.
  
1. They tried to connect to the wrong site.      
2. They didn't give their real e-mail address as the anomymous password. USE IT.
3. IN WS_FTP HOST NAME, PUT MY IP.
<P>
NOTE: FTP, (connect) TO THE IP ONLY.
