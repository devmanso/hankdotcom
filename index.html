The LINKS reflect some interests of mine.    
Any problems using them? Most of them were entered when I
made this page many years ago. Half of them don't work any more.
Does the HTML primer button still work?

If you suspect your computer is not working to its fullest potential, you might be right.
FACT:  Personal computers spend most of their power ON time waiting for 
their operators to tell them to do something, anything.  No Kidding!  Why not give your goofing-off
computer something useful to cogitate upon while it faithfully awaits your next
command?  Follow this link to SETI:

And now it's time to give credit where it's due.
Some really talented people have created artwork and have been kind enough to
allow the use of them on this web page.
I would like to give them all a plug here by name in order of their use date.  If I have left
any one out, it was not intentional. Please contact me. 

The walking spider was created by <A HREF="http://www.inscot.demon.co.uk">
 Lisa Konrad</A>, (lsk@inscot.demon.co.uk).  
BTW: I havn't talked to any of these folks for years now.
I hope they are doing well. If you read this contact me please.
As for this pretty waiving United States flag here? 
I don't know who did it; but thanks ever so much.  Long may she wave.

<CENTER>Disclaimer: This document and any of the links in NO WAY represents anybody or anything, except me.  
Except for where noted, this fabrication is mine alone.  
I do however, recommend the services of: ESOLUTIONS for a super ISP.  They are good folks.  
Their service is far above the norm.
I use GODADDY.COM for domain registration services. 
SMARTLINK.COM, HOST99.COM, NAMEGEAR.COM, GRAPEVINE.NET & V-POP have been long time associates.  They have done fine by me. I recommend them.  
As for all the rest<A HREF="hankx/index.html">:</A> My page being the exception, of course; You don't really take any thing you hear or see on the INTERNET too seriously, do you?  Really?  
Thank your lucky stars you didn't join those other well intentioned folks that 'beamed' themselves to Hale/Bopp eh?
 It's fun and all, and SUPER FAST with cable, satellite dish or DSL, but Gee-Whiz-Allready! 
<CENTER>Get a life! ;-)<CENTER>

<P>
Do you like the retro look?  I have purposely not done any web design since I made this page in 1992 when HTML was first being developed.  Then,almost immediately  some one came out with a product that did a better job automatically. Their bullets were better looking than mine.
I made the bullets on this page with a Crayon. I moved on as my stuff did what theirs did, only not as pretty. View the source document; You'll see what I mean.
If you want a pretty page; go and buy a web authoring package at BEST BUY.  They're inexpensive.
